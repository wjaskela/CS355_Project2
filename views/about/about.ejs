    <h1>Music Collection: About</h1>
    <p>
        The goal of this database is to have a central location for my music collection.  I can store the artist (band), albums and tracks they are associated with, record companies that sign contracts with the various artists,
        etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each artist will contain the band name, singerâ€™s name, when they were formed, the genre, where they started, and an associated website.  The albums will contain the title, an album cover picture, and the associated recording company that sells the album.  The tracks will contain the title, the duration of the track, the associated album, and the track number for that album.  Each record company will contain the name and location, along with their website (if it
        exists).
    </p>
